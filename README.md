# Use of AI Statement

AeroSLR is coded by myself as a learning project. This means I am learning ImGUI and OpenGL (as its related libraries), then applying my knowledge to AeroSLR. This means, however, that I am unable to implement all features and fix all bugs inside the app. This is where AIs, such as Github Copilot, come into use. Certain features and bug fixes are made by it. <br>
HOWEVER, the *core*, main features are developed by me, especially the OpenGL functionality, as that is the main purpose of AeroSLR. This means I understand and know ~80-90% of this code. I'm not being lazy, just making it easier for myself (Graphics programming is quite hard to learn!).
